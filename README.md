# eda_for_hotel_bookings

This project focuses on performing the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the hotel bookings dataset. We plan to undestand what the data is about and present visualizations of it.

You will find the dataset attached, along with the EDA jupyter notebook file. 

We use matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn and pandas packages to perform data visualizations on our dataset. 

Based on our analysis, it is safe to conclude that hotel bookings are mostly reserved by transient adults who, in most cases, pay no initial deposits. Most bookings occur at around August, and the least occur at around January and they are hardly canceled.
City hotels are more preferred than resort hotels. 
Bookings in resort hotels are mostly done by the agencies. The meal plan that is mostly ordered in these hotels is BB, and the least is FB.

Please note that you will find the Exploratory Data Analysis report here.
